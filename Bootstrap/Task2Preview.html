    <h1>Task2 Preview</h1>
   <p>Greetings Sir, this html page has a video attached below of the Bootstrap Task2 Preview on my computer. I have attached so, because due to non-responsiveness while on my screen it is perfectly aligned but on other screen sizes the webpage is getting disoriented. </p> 
   <p>I request you to consider the below video as well as the attached Task2 Webpage.</p>
   <h3>Thank You Sir 👍🏼</h3>
